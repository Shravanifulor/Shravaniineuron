    "1.What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate                intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans        solve problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "      Machine learning algorithms have had good results on problems such has spam detection in email, cancer diagnosis, fraudulent credit         card transactions, and automatically driving vehicles.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then you use the trained model on the test set to predict the response variable         values that are already known. The final step is to compare the predicted responses against the actual (observed) responses to see how       close they are.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Spam detection is a supervised machine learning problem. This means you must provide your machine learning model with a set of examples      of spam and ham messages and let it find the relevant patterns that separate the two different categories.\n",
