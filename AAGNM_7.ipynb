    " 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The re. compile() function returns Regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",

    " \n",
    " 3. What is the return value of the search() method? \n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    " \n",
    "    The search() method returns the index (position) of the first match. The search() method returns -1 if no match is found. The search()         method is case sensitive.   \n",

    " 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     -Import the regex module with import re.\n",
    "     -Create a Regex object with the re.\n",
    "     -Pass the string you want to search into the Regex object's search() method.\n",

    "    Group 2? Group 1?\n",

    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "    a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "     Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",

    "      a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "Ans:-  \n",
    "\n",
    "     Regular expression operators '+' and '*'are both greedy and match as many terms as possible. The difference between '+' and '*' is the       minimum number of matches.\n",

    " 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    *? is non-greedy. * will match nothing, but then will try to match extra characters until it matches 1 , eventually matching 101 .\n",

    " 16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     This flag allows for case-insensitive matching of the Regular Expression with the given string i.e. expressions like [A-Z] will match         lowercase letters, too. Generally, It's passed as an optional argument to re. compile() .\n",

    "    character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re. DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re. compile(),\n",
