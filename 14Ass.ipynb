    "Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster result at the runtime?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The plus-equals operator += provides a convenient way to add a value to an existing variable and assign the new value back to the same       variable. In the case where the variable and the value are strings, this operator performs string concatenation instead of addition.\n",
    "      Comparison can be faster if this code is executed on multiple variables allocated at scattered addresses in memory. With comparison         you will only read data from memory to the processor cache, and if you don't change the variable value when the cache decides to to         flush the line it will see that the line was not changed and there's no need to write it back to the memory. This can speed up               execution.\n",

    "     Use Python's min() and max() to find smallest and largest values in your data. Call min() and max() with a single iterable or with any      number of regular arguments. This expression is basically an algorithm for generating Fibonacci series.Basically everything which is on      the right side of the assignment operator(‘=’) gets evaluated and simplified first and then it is assigned to the left side of the          assignment operator due to lower precedence value of the assignment operator.\n",
