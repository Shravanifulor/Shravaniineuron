    " Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     a module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. If you need those          classes or functions in your project, you just import them. For instance, the math module in python contains just a bunch of functions,      and you just call those needed\n",

    "     To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Class attributes belong to the class itself they will be shared by all the instances. Such attributes are defined in the class body          parts usually at the top, for legibility. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by object.\n",

    "       Instance attributes are defined in the constructor. Defined directly inside a class. Defined inside a constructor using the self            parameter.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       Python operators work for built-in classes. But the same operator behaves differently with different types. For example, the +              operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.\n",

    " Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\"      operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is            overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Operator overloading is the process of using an operator in different ways depending on the operands. You can change the way an             operator in Python works on different data-types. A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator.\n",
