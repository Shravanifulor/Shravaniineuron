    "    A target function, in machine learning, is a method for solving a problem that an AI algorithm parses its training data to find. Once an     algorithm finds its target function, that function can be used to predict results (predictive analysis).\n",

    "ii. What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen?\n",
    "iii. In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Underfitting becomes obvious when the model is too simple and cannot create a relationship between the input and the output. It is          detected when the training error is very high and the model is unable to learn from the training data. High bias and low variance are        the most common indicators of underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Overfitting occurs when the model cannot generalize and fits too closely to the training dataset instead. Overfitting happens due to        several reasons, such as: • The training data size is too small and does not contain enough data samples to accurately represent all        possible input data values.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimated      across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters.\n",

    "    A set of clusters having high cohesion within the clusters and high separation between the clusters is considered to be good. In             practice, instead of dealing with two metrics, several measures are available which combine both of the above into a single measure. Few     examples of such measures are: Silhouette coefficient.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Fundamentally, classification is about predicting a label and regression is about predicting a quantity. Why linear regression can't         use for classification? The main reason for that is the predicted values are continuous, not probabilistic. So we can't get an exact         class to accomplish the classification.\n",

    "     The Average Silhouette Width (ASW) of a clustering is ̄ a ( i ) is the average distance of to points in the cluster to which it was          assigned, and is the average distance of to the points in the nearest cluster to which it was not assigned.   \n",

    "     Bagging is a technique for reducing prediction variance by producing additional data for training from a dataset by combining                repetitions with combinations to create multi-sets of the original data. Boosting is an iterative strategy for adjusting an                  observation's weight based on the previous classification.\n",

    "     A lazy learner delays abstracting from the data until it is asked to make a prediction while an eager learner abstracts away from the        data during training and uses this abstraction to make predictions rather than directly compare queries with instances in the dataset.\n",
