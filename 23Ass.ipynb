    "Q1. If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     a Bar Graph. Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time. However, when trying to          measure change over time, bar graphs are best when the changes are larger.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Compound interest causes your wealth to grow faster. It makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest because you          will earn returns on the money you invest, as well as on returns at the end of every compounding period. This means that you don't have      to put away as much money to reach your goals!\n",

    "      You can change the aspect ratio using the pbaspect function. Set the ratio as a three-element vector of positive values that represent       the relative axis lengths. For example, plot an elongated circle. Then set the plot box aspect ratio so that the x-axis is twice the         length of the y-axis and z-axis (not shown).\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The dtype of any numpy array containing string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array. Once set, it will only       be able to store new string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation."
