    " 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "    Functions reduce the need for duplicode code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. we can avoid rewriting     the same logic or code again and again in a programe.\n",

    "    \n",
    " 2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called? \n",
    "Ans:-  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function.\n",

    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    " 3. What statement creates a function?  \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The \"def\" keyword is a statement for a defining a function in python. a function is a group of related statements that performance a        specific task. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "       \n",
    " 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans :- \n",
    "      \n",
    "      A function is a block of code that does a particular operation and retuens a result. the parameters are not mandatory. \n",
    "      A function call is a code used to pass control to a function.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    " 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "      \n",
    "      At any given time during execution, you'll have at most four active Python scopes—local, enclosing, global, and built-in—depending on       where you are in the code. On the other hand, you'll always have at least two active scopes, which are the global and built-in scopes.\n",
    "     \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "     When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are distroyed.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    " 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?     \n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "    A return is a value that a function returns to the calling scripts or function when it completes its task. a return \n",
    "    value can be any one of the four variables types: handle, integer, object and string.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "      If no returns statements appears in a function defination, control automatically returns to the calling function after the last             statements of the called function is executed. \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    " 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "     When you creat a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. to creat a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.\n",

    " 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "     None is a data type of its own and only none can be none. it is a data type of the class NoneType object. \n",

    " 11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "     That import statements import a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. \n",

    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam? \n",
    "Ans:-   \n",
    "\n",
    "     This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",

    " 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    \n",
    "    When it encounters an error, the control is passed to the except block, skipping the code in between. As seen in the above code, we         have moved our code inside a try and except statement. Try running the program and it should throw an error message instead of               crashing the program\n",

    " 14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "\n",
    "     The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error.\n",
