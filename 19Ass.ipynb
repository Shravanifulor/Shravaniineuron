    "Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class         also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an \"instance\" of a class.\n",

    "Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Instance data is defined in the data division in the object paragraph of a class definition and is processed by procedural code in the      instance methods of that class. Instance data is organized into logical records and independent data description entries in the same        manner as program data.\n",

    "Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming. A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere      in your program. This eliminates the need for writing the same code again and again.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Use the super() Function\n",
    " \n",
    "    By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and         properties from its parent.\n",

    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In            encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their            current class\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a      block. Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is          destroyed.\n",

    "Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class&#39;s method definitions?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The self variable points to an instance of the class myClass when the method is revoked. Though the method takes only one parameter          here, it can also accept more than one parameter. The instance methods can easily access different attributes and other methods on the      same object with the help of the self variable.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The radd() method adds each value in the DataFrame with a specified value. This method is called reverse add, and is similar to the         add() method, but instead of calculating 100 + 15 it calculates 15 + 100 , which in this case will give the same result.\n",

    "And:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Reflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection,         then it is preferable to avoid using it.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The Python __iadd__() magic method implements in-place addition x += y that adds together the operands and assigns the result to the         left operand. This operation is also called augmented arithmetic assignment.\n",

    "Ams:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented approach. The __init__ function is called          every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other      purpose. It is only used within classes. "
