    " Q1.What is the purpose of Pythons OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to            implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",

    " Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an         object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree. Every time you use an expression of the form object.\n",

    " Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The Object is an actual thing that is built based on the 'blue print'. An instance is a virtual copy of the object.\n",
    "     object is instance of class and instance means representative of class i.e object.\n",

    " Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     This is the reason the first parameter of a function in class must be the object itself. Writing this parameter as self is merely a          convention. It is not a keyword and has no special meaning in Python.\n",

    " Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     \"__init__\" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object. This method is called when an object is           created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",

    " Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-  \n",
    "\n",
    "      To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "      -Create a Class. To create a class, use the keyword class : ...\n",
    "      -Create Object. Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects: ...\n",

    " Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. \n",
    "      The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a               subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well.\n",
