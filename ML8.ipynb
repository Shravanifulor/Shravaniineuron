    "1.What exactly is a feature? Give an example to illustrate your point.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    A feature is a unique quality or characteristic that something has. Real-life examples: Elaborately colored tail feathers are peacocks'     most well-known feature. Earth has many features, such as a particular atmosphere, abundance of water, and temperature that make it able     to sustain life.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    In One-Hot Encoding, each category of any categorical variable gets a new variable. It maps each category with binary numbers (0 or 1).     This type of encoding is used when the data is nominal. Newly created binary features can be considered dummy variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "     Discretization: It is the process of transforming continuous variables into categorical variables by creating a set of intervals, which      are contiguous, that span over the range of the variable's values. It is also known as “Binning”, where the bin is an analogous name        for an interval.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      In wrapper methods, the feature selection process is based on a specific machine learning algorithm that we are trying to fit on a           given dataset. It follows a greedy search approach by evaluating all the possible combinations of features against the evaluation           criterion\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      For example, if two features {X1, X2} are highly correlated, then the two features become redundant features since they have same           information in terms of correlation measure. In other words, the correlation measure provides statistical association between any           given a pair of features.\n",

    "\n",
    "     The main difference:- Feature Extraction transforms an arbitrary data, such as text or images, into numerical features that is              understood by machine learning algorithms. Feature Selection on the other hand is a machine learning technique applied on these              (numerical) features.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     SVD, or Singular Value Decomposition, is one of several techniques that can be used to reduce the dimensionality, i.e., the number of        columns, of a data set. Why would we want to reduce the number of dimensions? In predictive analytics, more columns normally means more      time required to build models and score data\n",
    "     \n",
    "     A hybrid feature selection method is proposed for classification in small sample size data sets. • The filter step is based on              instance learning taking advantage of the small sample size of data. • A few candidate feature subsets are generated since their number      corresponds to the number of instances.\n",

    "     The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is defined as a plot of test sensitivity as the y coordinate versus its 1-          specificity or false positive rate (FPR) as the x coordinate, is an effective method of evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests.\n",
