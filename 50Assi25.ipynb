    "1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Square brackets are lists while parentheses are tuples.\n",

    "2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Iterators are used mostly to iterate or convert other objects to an iterator using iter() function.\tGenerators are mostly used in loops to          generate an iterator by returning all the values in the loop without affecting the iteration of the loop.\n",

    "3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values.      In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement.\n",

    "4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "     The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield, instead of simply returning a value\n",

    "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "      List comprehension returns a list, whereas the map function returns an object of Iterable. List comprehension execution is faster than that of         map function when the formula expression is huge and complex. Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined       as a function earlier.     \n",
