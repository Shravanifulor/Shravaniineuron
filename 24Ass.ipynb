    "Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where     it would be beneficial?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     If multiple modules imports the same module then angular evaluates it only once (When it encounters the module first time). It follows      this condition even the module appears at any level in a hierarchy of imported NgModules. 1.\n",

    "    Characteristics of Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Modules contain instructions, processing logic, and data.\n",
    "    -Modules can be separately compiled and stored in a library.\n",
    "    -Modules can be included in a program.\n",
    "    -Module segments can be used by invoking a name and some parameters.\n",

    "Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren&#39;t visible. How can you       go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Circular dependencies create tight couplings between the classes or modules involved, which means both classes or modules have to be         recompiled every time either of them is changed.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Conclusion. There is a really nice use case for the __name__ variable, whether you want a file that can be run as the main program or       imported by other modules. We can use an if __name__ == \"__main__\" block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the           modules are imported.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     This advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation, since the        stack holds all arguments in a last-in, first out progression. For example, to compute the expression (3 × 4) + (5 × 6), one would type      3, press Enter ↑ , and type 4.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     An assignment statement always has a single variable on the left hand side. The value of the expression (which can contain math              operators and other variables) on the right of the = sign is stored in the variable on the left.\n",
