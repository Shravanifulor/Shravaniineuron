    "Q1. Can you create a programme or function that employs both positive and negative indexing? Is there any repercussion if you do so?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       In Python, you can start indexing from the end of an iterable. This is known as negative indexing. This means you can use both              positive and negative indexes to access iterables. no there is no repurcussion.\n",

    "Q2. What is the most effective way of starting with 1,000 elements in a Python list? Assume that all elements should be set to the same value.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The following are some of the ways to initialize lists(we create lists of size 1000 and initialize with zeros) in Python.\n",
    "      -Using a for loop and append() ...\n",
    "      -Using a while loop with a counter variable. ...\n",
    "      -Using list comprehensions. ...\n",
    "      -Using the * operator.\n",

    "Q3. How do you slice a list to get any other part while missing the rest? (For example, suppose you want to make a new list with the elements first,       third, fifth, seventh, and so on.)\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The format for list slicing is [start:stop:step].\n",
    "     -start is the index of the list where slicing starts.\n",
    "     -stop is the index of the list where slicing ends.\n",
    "     -step allows you to select nth item within the range start to stop.\n",

    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between indexing and slicing.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     “Indexing” means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an      iterable based on their indices.\n",

    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "Q5. What happens if one of the slicing expression's indexes is out of range?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The slicing operation doesn't raise an error if both your start and stop indices are larger than the sequence length. This is in contrast to           simple indexing—if you index an element that is out of bounds, Python will throw an index out of bounds error. However, with slicing it simply         returns an empty sequence.\n",

    "Q6. If you pass a list to a function, and if you want the function to be able to change the values of the list—so that the list is different     after the function returns—what action should you avoid?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data       type inside the function.\n",

    "Q7. What is the concept of an unbalanced matrix?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Whenever the cost matrix of an assignment problem is not a square matrix, that is, whenever the number of sources is not equal to the       number of destinations, the assignment problem is called an unbalanced assignment problem.\n",

    "Q8. Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       List comprehensions are faster than for loops to create lists. But, this is because we are creating a list by appending new elements        to it at each iteration."
