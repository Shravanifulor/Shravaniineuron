    "  1) In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be \n",
    "     mathematical operators.    \n",
    "\n",
    "    * :- multiplication operator use in python\n",
    "    \"hello\" :- it is a string operator which are use the word hello\n",
    "    -87.8 :- in python it is a float valuse \n",
    "    -: it is used to divids the valuse\n",
    "    / :- slash         \n",
    "    +:- addition          \n",
    "    6 :- int\n",

    "  2) What is difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-    String is a type of data which is used or closed  in single and double  quote  of string values so, we can fill up a variable.\n",
    "         Variable is a symbols that we can use to store data in a program.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    "      \n",

    "  3) Descibe three different data types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1)String:- a string is a charectors put in programming in a single and double code that is quotation marks in python. \n",
    "    2)List:- list is like a aarays, list can contain the data of different types and it a ordered sequence of item.  \n",
    "    3)boolean:- ot is type provides  two built-in values, true and false values in python.\n",
    "    4)tuple:- tuple is collection of python objects. its just like list and tuple is immutable in python. \n",
    "    5)set:- set can be created by usisng the built-in set. in st, the order the order of elements is undefined.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "  4) What is an expression made up of? what do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An expression is a combination of operators ans operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.\n",
    "    it is produce some other value. in the programming languvage, an expression is evaluated as per the procedence of its operators.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "      \n",
    "  5) This assignments statements, like spam = 10. what is the diffrence between an expression and a statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- an expression evaluates to a single value i.e., it is a combination of variables, operations ans values. a statements does not.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "  6) after running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    bacon = 22\n",
    "    bacon + 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:- the bacon variable is set to 20. the bacon +1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  7) What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    'spam'+'spamspam'\n",
    "    'spam' \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:- both expressions evaluated to the string 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  8) why is eggs valid a variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- variable names cannot begin with a number and eggs is not a number so, thats why its invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  9) What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- the int(), float() and str() functions will evaluated to the integer, floationg-point number and string version of the value passed to       them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  10) Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "    'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:- The expression causes an error because 99 is a integer, and only string can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. the       currect way to written is 'i have eaten' + str(99)+'burritos'.\n",
