    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "      Both lambda and def create the same kind of function â€“ they have the same kind of metadata and capabilities. Their technical difference is             syntactical: A lambda is an expression producing a function. A def is a statement producing a function.\n",

    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions          declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are required.\n",

    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "Ans:-  \n",
    "\n",
    "      Both map and reduce have as input the array and a function you define. They are in some way complementary: map cannot return one single element       for an array of multiple elements, while reduce will always return the accumulator you eventually changed.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Recursive Function is a function that repeats or uses its own previous term to calculate subsequent terms and thus forms a sequence of terms. Usually, we learn about this function based on the arithmetic-geometric sequence, which has terms with a common difference between them.\n",

    "4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at          compile time and have no life in python's runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations.\n",

    "   \n",
    "      Recursive Function is a function that repeats or uses its own previous term to calculate subsequent terms and thus forms a sequence of terms.

    "      Safe: It can be used without causing harm.\n",
    "      Secure: It can't be hacked.\n",
    "      Reliable: It functions as it should, every time.\n",
    "      Testable: It can be tested at the code level.\n",

    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "      But for functions with arguments, we can call a function in two different ways, based on how we specify the arguments, and these two ways are:         Call by Value. Call by Reference.\n",
