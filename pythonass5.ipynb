    " Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base       case.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",

    "     Delegation is commonly defined as the shifting of authority and responsibility for particular functions, tasks or decisions from one person to        another.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Composition is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It describes a class that references one or more objects of other       classes in instance variables.\n",

    " Q4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument         which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound         methods.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Attributes of a class are function objects that define corresponding methods of its instances. They are used to implement access controls of the       classes. the problem that the pseudo-private attribute feature is meant to alleviate has to do with the way instance attributes are stored. In         Python, all instance attributes wind up in the single instance object at the bottom of the class tree\n",
