    " Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "     \n",
    "      Using this special method, you will be able to change the built-in behavior of the operator such as: +, -, /, or *. This special method is             surrounded by double underscores (__).\n",

    " Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "        printing has its own associated magic method, __str__(). If we were to print the plain Point class with just the lone __init__(), we would get         the not-so-user-friendly output.\n",
    "        Adding the __str__() method into the Point class will remedy that. Interestingly, format() also invokes the same __str__() method that print()         does.\n",

    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The slice() function returns a slice object. A slice object is used to specify how to slice a sequence. You can specify where to start the             slicing, and where to end. You can also specify the step, which allows you to e.g. slice only every other item.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       This function is used to assign and add the current value. This operation does “a+=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of                immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       Operator overloading is mostly useful when you're making a new class that falls into an existing \"Abstract Base Class\". It is basically used          for operating on user-defined datatypes, like classes and structures.\n",
