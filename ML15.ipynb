    "1.Recognize the differences between supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overview. Within the field of machine learning, there are three main types of tasks: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised. The     main difference between these types is the level of availability of ground truth data, which is prior knowledge of what the output of       the model should be for a given input.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say           regression problems as well its best suited for classification.
