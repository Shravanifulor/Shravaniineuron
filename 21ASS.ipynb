    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      A probability distribution is a list of all of the possible outcomes of a random variable, along with its corresponding probability         values. A probability distribution links each outcome of a random variable or process with its probability of occurrence.\n",

    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good           enough”?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Software-generated random numbers only are pseudorandom. They are not truly random because the computer uses an algorithm based on a         distribution, and are not secure because they rely on deterministic, predictable algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "     The two main parameters of a (normal) distribution are the mean and standard deviation.\n",

    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     A fair rolling of dice is also a good example of normal distribution. In an experiment, it has been found that when a dice is rolled        100 times, chances to get '1' are 15-18% and if we roll the dice 1000 times, the chances to get '1' is, again, the same, which averages      to 16.7% (1/6).\n",

    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     For theoretical probability, it doesn't require you to actually do the experiment and then look at the results. Instead, the                theoretical probability is what you expect to happen in an experiment (the expected probability). This is the theoretical probability        definition.\n",

    "     Based on the domain, the types of functions are algebraic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric. The functions based on the          range are modulus, rational, signum, even and odd, periodic, greatest integer, smallest integer, inverse and composite functions.\n",
