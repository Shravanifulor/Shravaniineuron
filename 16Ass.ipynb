    "Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supported by almost any language, there are only a few programming languages which do not understand regular expressions; Do more with       less, keep your code cleaner; Faster validations, instead of having many IF and ELSE operators you may validate only once with a regular     expression.\n",

    "Q5. How does compiling a regular-expression object benefit you?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      We can combine a regular expression pattern into pattern objects, which can be used for pattern matching. It also helps to search a         pattern again without rewriting it.\n",

    "Q6. What are some examples of how to use the match object returned by re.match and re.search?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The re.search() and re.match() both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in      strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match()     searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the       middle of the string, it returns none. \n",
    "    While re.search() searches for the whole string even if the string contains multi-lines and tries to find a match of the substring in       all the lines of string.\n",

    "Q7. What is the difference between using a vertical bar (|) as an alteration and using square brackets as a character set?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The vertical bar symbol acts as an OR operator and matches the values to the left and right of the vertical bar. For example, the            regular expression Jack|Jill matches Jack and Jill . \\ (backslash) The backslash symbol acts as an escape sequence. Use it when you          want search for a regular expression symbol.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
