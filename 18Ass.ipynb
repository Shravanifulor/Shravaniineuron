    "Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Text files are organized around lines, each of which ends with a newline character ('\\n'). The source code files are themselves text        files. A binary file is the one in which data is stored in the file in the same way as it is stored in the main memory for processing.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The text files can easily be transferred from one computer system to another. Binary files cannot easily be transferred from one             computer system to another due to variations in the internal variations in the internal representation which varies from computer to         computer.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      To open a file in binary format, add 'b' to the mode parameter. Hence the \"rb\" mode opens the file in binary format for reading, while       the \"wb\" mode opens the file in binary format for writing. Unlike text files, binary files are not human-readable.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Using with means that the file will be closed as soon as you leave the block. This is beneficial because closing a file is something         that can easily be forgotten and ties up resources that you no longer need. Note that this isn't specific to Python 3 at all.\n",
