    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate                intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans        solve problems.\n",

    "      If a model has been trained too well on training data, it will be unable to generalize. It will make inaccurate predictions when given       new data, making the model useless even though it is able to make accurate predictions for the training data.
