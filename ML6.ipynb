    "1.In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data,       providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "    The “no free lunch” (NFL) theorem for supervised machine learning is a theorem that essentially implies that no single machine learning     algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    K-fold Cross-Validation is when the dataset is split into a K number of folds and is used to evaluate the model's ability when given new     data. K refers to the number of groups the data sample is split into. For example, if you see that the k-value is 5, we can call this a     5-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The bootstrap method is a statistical technique for estimating quantities about a population by averaging estimates from multiple small      data samples. Importantly, samples are constructed by drawing observations from a large data sample one at a time and returning them to      the data sample after they have been chosen.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results. Ensemble methods usually     produces more accurate solutions than a single model would. This has been the case in a number of machine learning competitions, where       the winning solutions used ensemble methods.   \n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Descriptive modeling is a mathematical process that describes real-world events and the relationships between factors responsible for       them. The process is used by consumer-driven organizations to help them target their marketing and advertising efforts.\n",
    "    Descriptive statistics help us to simplify large amounts of data in a sensible way. Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data into     a simpler summary. For instance, consider a simple number used to summarize how well a batter is performing in baseball, the batting         average.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linear Regression Analysis consists of more than just fitting a linear line through a cloud of data points. It consists of 3 stages –       (1) analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data, (2) estimating the model, i.e., fitting the line, and (3) evaluating the       validity and usefulness of the model.\n",

    "3.Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "    While descriptive analytics are used by companies to understand what has happened, predictive analytics are used by companies to             determine what is likely to happen next.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A model that is underfit will have high training and high testing error while an overfit model will have extremely low training error       but a high testing error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In summary, Cross validation splits the available dataset to create multiple datasets, and Bootstrapping method uses the original           dataset to create multiple datasets after resampling with replacement. Bootstrapping it is not as strong as Cross validation when it is     used for model validation.\n",

    "    OOCV(Leave One Out Cross-Validation) is a type of cross-validation approach in which each observation is considered as the validation       set and the rest (N-1) observations are considered as the training set. In LOOCV, fitting of the model is done and predicting using one     observation validation set.\n",

    "    The F-measure of the system is defined as the weighted harmonic mean of its precision and recall, that is, F = {1\\over \\alpha {1\\over       P}+(1-\\alpha ) {1\\over R}}, where the weight α ∈ [0,1]. The balanced F-measure, commonly denoted as F 1 or just F, equally weighs           precision and recall, which means α = 1∕2.\n",
