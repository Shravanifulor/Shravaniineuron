    " 1. What advantages to exel spreadsheets have over CSV spredsheets?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    While Excel (XLS and XLSX) file formats are better for storing more complex data, CSV files are supported by nearly all data upload         interfaces. If you are planning to move your data between platforms, export and import it from one interface to another, you might be       better  off with the CSV file format.\n",

    " 2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    "Ans:-  \n",
    "   \n",
    "      First, call open() and pass it 'w' to open a file in write mode . This will create the object you can then pass to csv. writer() to          create a Writer object. On Windows, you'll also need to pass a blank string for the open() function's newline keyword argument.\n",

    " 3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Here mode means the operation for which the file has to be opened like <r> for reading, <w> for writing, <+> for both reading and            writing, <a> for appending at the end of an existing file. The default is the read mode. In addition, we can specify whether the file        will be handled as binary (<b>) or text mode.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    A CSV file is a bounded text format which uses a comma to separate values. The most common method to write data from a list to CSV file       is the writerow() method of writer and DictWriter class.\n",

    "    The delimiter is the character that appears between cells on a row. By default, the delimiter for a CSV file is a comma. The line           terminator is the character that comes at the end of a row. By default, the line terminator is a newline\n",
