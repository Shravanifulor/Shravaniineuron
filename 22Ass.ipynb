    "Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",

    "    Functions of Array\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Get the Type Code. Since the type code is very important to an array, which determined what kind of elements that the array can have.\n",

    "Q2. What are some of the array package's limitations?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Insertion and deletion operations are costly in arrays as elements are stored in contiguous memory. If the size of the declared array        is more than the required size then, it can lead to memory wastage.\n",

    "Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will          create a new array and delete the original. The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will        be the same size in memory.\n",

    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between the empty, ones, and zeros functions.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     empty, unlike zeros, does not set the array values to zero, and may therefore be marginally faster. On the other hand, it requires the      user to manually set all the values in the array, and should be used with caution.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     sum receives an array of booleans as its argument, it'll sum each element (count True as 1 and False as 0) and return the outcome. for      instance np. sum([True, True, False]) will output 2 :) Hope this helps.\n",

    "      The sub-module numpy.linalg implements basic linear algebra, such as solving linear systems, singular value decomposition, etc.             However, it is not guaranteed to be compiled using efficient routines, and thus we recommend the use of scipy.linalg, as detailed in         section Linear algebra operations: scipy.linalg\n",
