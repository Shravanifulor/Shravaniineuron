    "1.What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Many examples of this case are found in case of human learning. Learning to drive a motor-car, typewriting, singing or memorizing a          poem or a mathematical table, and music etc. need exercise and repetition of various movements and actions many times.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Machine Learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational           methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Reinforcement learning is all about gamifying the learning process. This type of machine learning uses a reward-penalty method to           teach an AI system. If it makes the right move, it gets rewarded. If it makes a mistake, it receives a penalty.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis            representation. The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The goal of machine learning is often — though not always — to train a model on historical, labelled data (i.e., data for which the          outcome is known) in order to predict the value of some quantity on the basis of a new data item for which the target value or              classification is unknown.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     There are three main elements to every machine learning algorithm, and they include:\n",
    "\n",
    "     -Representation: what the model looks like; how knowledge is represented.\n",
    "     -Evaluation: how good models are differentiated; how programs are evaluated.\n",

    "8.Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    " \n",
    "     In simple terms, abstraction “displays” only the relevant attributes of objects and “hides” the unnecessary details. For example, when      we are driving a car, we are only concerned about driving the car like start/stop the car, accelerate/ break, etc.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    " \n",
    "     Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the      one used to create the model. Develop intuition about overfitting. Determine whether a model is good or not. Divide a data set into a        training set and a test set.\n",

    "10.What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The most significant difference between regression vs classification is that while regression helps predict a continuous quantity,          classification predicts discrete class labels. There are also some overlaps between the two types of machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     For example, it can be used to predict the relationship between reckless driving and the total number of road accidents caused by a          driver, or, to use a business example, the effect on sales and spending a certain amount of money on advertising. Regression is one of      the most common models of machine learning.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are       more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with         similar traits and assign them into clusters\n",
