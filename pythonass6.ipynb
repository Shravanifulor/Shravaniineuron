    " Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",

    "     There are three types of exception—the checked exception, the error and the runtime exception.\n",

    "\n",
    "      An exception object is created when a Python script raises an exception. If the script explicitly doesn't handle the exception, the program will       be forced to terminate abruptly.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception. After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code       in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception. The else-block is a good place for code that does not need       the try: block's protection.\n",

    " \n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "     there are two methods to handle Python exceptions: Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program. Raise – Triggers an exception      manually using custom exceptions.\n",

    "      whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     A try statement includes keyword try, followed by a colon (:) and a suite of code in which exceptions may occur. It has one or more clauses.\n",
    "     During the execution of the try statement, if no exceptions occurred then, the interpreter ignores the exception handlers for that specific try        statement.\n",
    "     Catch blocks take one argument at a time, which is the type of exception that it is likely to catch. These arguments may range from a specific        type of exception which can be varied to a catch-all category of exceptions.\n",
