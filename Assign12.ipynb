    "Q1. Does assigning a value to a string's indexed character violate Python's string immutability?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assigning a new value to an existing variable is perfectly valid. Python does not have constants. This is independent from data type         mutability. You may want to take a look at the id() function.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     It violates the rules of how ID values and += are supposed to work - the ID values produced with the optimization in place would be not      only impossible, but prohibited, with the unoptimized semantics - but the developers care more about people who would see bad                concatenation performance and assume Python sucks.\n",

    "Q4. What is the relationship between indexing and slicing?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      “Indexing” means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of             elements from an iterable based on their indices.\n",

    "Q5. What is an indexed character's exact data type? What is the data form of a slicing-generated substring?     \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       Python has no special type for a single character. It is just a string of length 1.\n",
    "       A Python substring is a portion of text taken from a string. You can extract a substring in Python using slicing, with the format:          YourString[StartingIndex:StoppingIndex:CharactersToSkip]. Often, programmers have data that they want to split up into different            parts.\n",

    "Q6. What is the relationship between string and character \"types\" in Python? \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python       does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access         elements of the string.\n",

    "Q7. Identify at least two operators and one method that allow you to combine one or more smaller strings to create a larger string.     \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       You can combine both string variables and string literals using the “+” operator. However, there's another method that allows an easy        way of concatenating multiple strings. It is using the in-place (+=) operator.\n",

    "Q8. What is the benefit of first checking the target string with in or not in before using the index method to find a substring?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      We can also use string find() function to check if string contains a substring or not. This function returns the first index position       where substring is found, else returns -1\n",

    "Q9. Which operators and built-in string methods produce simple Boolean (true/false) results?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     However, and and or are so useful that all programming languages have both. There are sixteen possible two-input Boolean operators.          Except for and and or , they are rarely needed in practice. Because of this, True , False , not , and , and or are the only built-in        Python Boolean operators.\n",
