    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    To be able to call logging.debug(), you must have these two lines at the start of your program:\n",
    "\n",

    "   logging message to a file named programLog.txt?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "       To be able to send logging messages to a file named programLog.txt with logging.debug(), you must have these two lines at the start          of your program:\n",
    "\n",
    "       import logging\n",
    "       logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG,\n",

    " 6. What are the five levels of logging?\n",
    "Ans:- \n",

    "    DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL\n",

    " 8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     You can disable logging messages without removing the logging function calls. You can selectively disable lower-level logging messages.        You can create logging messages. Logging messages provides a timestamp.\n",

    " 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?   \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      The Step button will move the debugger into a function call. The Over button will quickly execute the function call without stepping         into it. The Out button will quickly execute the rest of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " 10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "    After you click Go, the debugger will stop when it has reached the end of the program or a line with a breakpoint.\n",
