    "1.Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classe's benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Float stores an approximate value and decimal stores an exact value. In summary, exact values like money should use decimal, and            approximate values like scientific measurements should use float. When multiplying a non integer and dividing by that same number,          decimals lose precision while floats do not.\n",

    "2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of        representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      In Python, there is a module called Decimal, which is used to do some decimal floating point related tasks. This module provides             correctly-rounded floating point arithmetic. To use it at first we need to import it the Decimal standard library module. import             decimal.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     For Double , 1.20 is exactly the same as 1.2 , so you can't convert them to different BigDecimal s.\n",
    "     The implication of writing it as 1.20 could be that it is was measured to the nearest 1/100 so would be more accurate than 1.2 which        may have been measured to the nearer 1/10. But then again it might not be.\n",

    "      An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without * a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means * it         is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when * more precision is needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "     When doing any kind of calculation with currency, accuracy is extremely important. And floating point numbers (floats and doubles)          don't have an accurate enough representation to prevent rounding errors from accumulating when doing arithmetic with monetary values.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",

    "     5/10 is equal to ½ after simplification. Hence, the equivalent fractions of 5/10 are: ½, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8 and so on.\n",
