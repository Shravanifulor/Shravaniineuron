    "    Visualize the data to understand how it is structured and understand the relationship between various variables and classes present.         Splitting the cleaned data into two sets - a training set and a testing set. The training set is the set your model learns from.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data can come in many forms, but machine learning models rely on four primary data types. These include numerical data, categorical         data, time series data, and text data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Numerical data, as the name implies, refers to numbers. Categorical data is everything else. Categorical data is non-numerical              information that is divided into groups. As its name suggests, categorical data describes categories or groups.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     While both methods are used for reducing the number of features in a dataset, there is an important difference. Feature selection is        simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them. Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower d            dimension\n",

    "2.Use a scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "3.PCA (Personal Computer Aid)\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A histogram is a display of statistical information that uses rectangles to show the frequency of data items in successive numerical         intervals of equal size. In the most common form of histogram, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis and the         dependent variable is plotted along the vertical axis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     \n",
    "    Scatter plots are used to plot data points on a horizontal and a vertical axis in the attempt to show how much one variable is affected     by another. Each row in the data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X and Y     axes. \n",

    "     Businesses make use of PCs to perform tasks like accounting, desktop publishing and word processing as well as to run database and          spreadsheets. At home, PCs are mainly used for multimedia entertainment, playing PC games, accessing the Internet, etc.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     The combination of qualitative and quantitative data can also lead to clashes in the philosophical assumptions behind each approach and      therefore recommendations have been made for triangulation to be carried out from a pragmatic, or subtle realist, approach\n",

    "\n",
    "    Bell-shaped: A bell-shaped picture, shown below, usually presents a normal distribution. Bimodal: A bimodal shape, shown below, has two     peaks. This shape may show that the data has come from two different systems. If this shape occurs, the two sources should be separated     and analyzed separately.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are three main measures of central tendency: the mode, the median and the mean. Each of these measures describes a different           indication of the typical or central value in the distribution.\n",
    "    The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it uses all values in the data set to give you an average. For     data from skewed distributions, the median is better than the mean because it isn't influenced by extremely large values.   \n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     If there is a regression line on a scatter plot, you can identify outliers. An outlier for a scatter plot is the point or points that        are farthest from the regression line. There is at least one outlier on a scatter plot in most cases, and there is usually only one          outlier.\n",

    "      Cross tabulation is a method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between multiple variables. Also known as contingency tables         or cross tabs, cross tabulation groups variables to understand the correlation between different variables. It also shows how c             correlations change from one variable grouping to another."
