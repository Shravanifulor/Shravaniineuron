    "1.What are the key tasks that machine learning entails? What does data pre-processing imply?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and          crucial step while creating a machine learning model. When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come        across the clean and formatted data.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Quantitative data refers to any information that can be quantified, counted or measured, and given a numerical value. Qualitative data       is descriptive in nature, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values. Quantitative research is based on numeric data.\n",

    "   \n",
    "      What type of data does machine learning need? Data can come in many forms, but machine learning models rely on four primary data             types. These include numerical data, categorical data, time series data, and text data.\n",

    "   \n",
    "      The number one problem facing Machine Learning is the lack of good data. While enhancing algorithms often consumes most of the time of       developers in AI, data quality is essential for the algorithms to function as intended.\n",

    "     Data exploration is the first step of data analysis used to explore and visualize data to uncover insights from the start or identify        areas or patterns to dig into more.

    "     Missing values can be handled by deleting the rows or columns having null values. If columns have more than half of the rows as null        then the entire column can be dropped. The rows which are having one or more columns values as null can also be dropped.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "      Data Preprocessing can be done in four different ways. Data cleaning/cleaning, data integration, data transformation, and data               reduction are the four categories.\n",

    "     A box and whisker plot—also called a box plot—displays the five-number summary of a set of data. The five-number summary is the              minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In a box plot, we draw a box from the first quartile to the third              quartile.
