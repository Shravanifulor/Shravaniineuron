    "1.Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "     Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some                phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal        belief.\n",

    "     A joint probability is a possibility of occurring one or more independent events simultaneously, denoted as P (A∩B) or P (A and B). One      can calculate it by multiplying the probability of both outcomes = P (A)*P (B).\n",

    "      Conditional probability is known as the possibility of an event or outcome happening, based on the existence of a previous event or         outcome.

These statements identify specific variables and propose results. In this example, the variable is the amount of sugar       and the result is developing cavities."
